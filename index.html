<p><b>Raphael's short biography:</b></br>
Raphael S. Carvalho is a computer programmer who loves open source, and especially kernel programming. Raphael made his first steps into the open source world, when he sent a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8db049b3d666b3676ff4a976e03c14de302bf9fa">patch</a> to slightly improve the PID allocation code from the Linux kernel. He has worked on bringing new file system support and additional features for the open source project <a href="http://www.syslinux.org">Syslinux</a>, which is a suite of lightweight IBM PC bootloaders. He works at <a href="http://www.cloudius-systems.com">Cloudius Systems</a>, an israeli startup. Nowadays, he's mostly involved with the file system technology from <a href="http://osv.io">OSv</a>, a cloud-based operating system. 
<p>By the time being, I can share with you some geek jokes. Ready to have a lot of fun?</br>

<b>Q:</b> When do you know that you've been coding too much?</br>
<b>A:</b> When you try to talk to another human and have trouble with the syntax of your native language.</br>
-----</br>
<b>Q:</b> What are some things that programmers and computer scientists know, but most people don't?</br>
<b>A:</b> Try telling this to a normal person: "A parent may kill its children if the task assigned to them is no longer needed"</br>
